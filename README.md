# ASketch: A Sketching Framework for Alloy

`ASketch` is a command line tool built on top of
[Alloy5.0](https://github.com/AlloyTools/org.alloytools.alloy).  Given
a partial Alloy model, a candidate fragment generator, and a set of
AUnit tests that capture the desired model properties, `ASketch` is
able to fill holes with the corresponding candidate fragments and
makes the completed model satisfy all AUnit tests.  Internally,
`ASketch` automatically encodes the sketching problem into a meta
Alloy model and invokes the Alloy analyzer to search for solutions.

# Requirements:

* Operating Systems
  - Linux (64 bit)
  - Mac OS (64 bit)

* Dependencies
  - Java 8: Must be installed and accessible from `PATH`.
  - Bash 4.4: Must be installed and accessible from `PATH`.
  - Maven >3.5.2: Must be installed and accessible from `PATH`.
  - Alloy 5.0: Must be in the classpath.  `ASketch` comes with
    Alloy5.0 under `libs/alloy.jar`.

# Installation:

## Clone ASketch repo

To run `ASketch`, use `git` to clone the repository.

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:kaiyuanw/ASketch.git
```

## Build ASketch

To build `ASketch`, Java 8 and Maven 3.5.2 or above must be installed.
Then, you can run `./asketch.sh --build` in Bash 4.4 to build
`ASketch`.

# Quick Start:

## Sketch Partial Models

To sketch a partial Alloy model, run
```Shell
./asketch.sh --run -m <arg> -f <arg> -t <arg> [-s <arg>] [-n <arg>]
```
or use the full argument name
```Shell
./asketch.sh --run --model-path <arg> --fragment-path <arg> --test-path <arg> [--scope <arg>] [--sol-num <arg>]
```
 * `-m,--model-path`: This argument is required.  Pass the partial
   Alloy model with holes that you want to sketch as the argument.
 * `-f,--fragment-path`: This argument is required.  Pass the
   generator which provides the candidate fragments to be considered
   for each hole as the argument.  Note that the candidate expressions
   for expression holes can be automatically generated by
   [RexGen](#publications), which we may release in the future.
 * `-t,--test-path`: This argument is required.  Pass the test file
   which contains AUnit tests that capture the desired properties of
   the expected model as the argument.  Note that
   [MuAlloy](https://github.com/kaiyuanw/MuAlloy) provides a way to
   generate mutant killing AUnit tests.  If you use MuAlloy, you still
   need to manually label whether the predicate your want to sketch is
   valid or not given a generated AUnit test.  You can also manually
   write AUnit tests following the
   [examples](https://github.com/kaiyuanw/ASketch/tree/master/experiments/tests).
 * `-s,--scope`: This argument is optional.  Pass the Alloy scope for
   solving the generated meta Alloy model.  The scope is typically
   larger than or equal to the minimum scope necessary to make all
   AUnit tests satisfiable.  If the argument is not specified, a
   default value of 3 is used.
 * `-n,--sol-num`: This argument is optional.  Pass the number of
   unique solutions to the sketching problem you want `ASketch` to
   report.  A solution is unique if no other solution shares the
   syntactically same combination of the actual fragments across all
   holes.  If the argument is not specified, a default value of 1 is
   used.

For each run, the command reports: (1) the interpreted candidate
fragments for each hole provided by the generator; (2) the order, the
associated identifier, the type and the search space size for each
hole; (3) the size of the entire search space computed by multiplying
the sizes of individual search spaces of all holes; and (4) a set of
solutions if any as well as the solving time for each solution.

The generated meta Alloy model will be stored under the project hidden
directory at `${project_dir}/.hidden/solve.als` in case if you want to
extend `ASketch` and debug the tool.

## Included Examples

We provide 10 example subjects and the command to run them.  Each
subject comes with a partial Alloy model, a generator and a set of
AUnit tests.  The `experiments/models` directory contains all example
models.  The `experiments/fragments` directory contains all
generators.  The `experiments/tests` directory contains all AUnit
tests.  The example models are listed below:

 * `arr` models an array.
 * `bt` models a binary tree.
 * `cd` models a Java class diagram.
 * `contains` checks whether a list contains an element.
 * `ctree` models a two colored undirected tree.
 * `deadlock` models a process deadlock.
 * `dll` models a doubly-linked list.
 * `grade` models how teaching assistants grade assignments.
 * `remove` models removing an element from a list.
 * `sll`: models a singly-linked list.

To sketch a given example model, run
```Shell
./asketch.sh --run-example ${model}
```
where `${model}` can be one of `[arr, bt, cd, contains, ctree,
deadlock, dll, grade, remove, sll]`.  By default, `ASketch` reads the
model, the generator and the AUnit tests from
`experiments/models/${model}.als`,
`experiments/fragments/${model}.txt` and
`experiments/tests/${model}.als`, respectively.  The solution is
reported to the standard output.  The scope used varies for different
models and the default number of solutions to report is 1.  For more
details, take a look at `models.sh`.

To sketch all 10 example models, run
```Shell
./asketch.sh --run-all
```

# Supported Holes

`ASketch` supports the following hole types:

| Hole Type | Notation | Candidate |
|----------|----------|---------|
|   Binary Operator    | \BO\ | `&, +, -` |
|   Compare Operator    | \CO\ | `=, in, !=, !in` |
|   Logical Operator    | \LO\ | `\|\|, &&, <=>, =>` |
|   Quantifier    | \Q\ | `all, no, some, lone, one` |
|   Unary Operator    | \UO\ | `no, some, lone, one` |
|   Unary Operator Expression    | \UOE\ | `~, *, ^` |
|   Unary Operator Formula    | \UOF\ | `!, ɛ`
|   Expression    | \E\ | any expression |

For example, users can write `\Q,identifier\` to create a quantifier
hole, where the `identifier` refers to a candidate fragment generator.
The generator is provided as a regular expression following the
grammar below:

```
regExDecl := identifier ":=" "(|" regex "|)"
    regex := nonSpecial | regex "?" | "(" regex ")" | regex regex | regex "|" regex
```

The above grammar follows the popular JSketch framework which includes
a few regular expression operators: options (`regex "?"`),
concatenations (`regex regex`), and choices (`regex "|" regex`).
`nonSpecial` is any string that contains characters supported by Alloy
grammar except for `(`, `)` and `|`; to use those, requires escaping
them as `\(`, `\)` and `\|`.  The
[grammar](https://github.com/kaiyuanw/ASketch/blob/master/src/main/antlr4/asketch/compiler/RegExpr.g4)
is implemented in ANTLR4.  Note that we use `ɛ` to denote space in the
grammar.  In addition, the candidate fragments for operator holes must
be a subset of all possible fragments in the table.


# Background

## Alloy Model

We show a [acyclic singly linked list](experiments/models/sll.als)
Alloy model below:
```Alloy
one sig List {
  header: lone Node
}
sig Node {
  link: lone Node
}
pred Acyclic () {
  all n: Node | n in List.header.*link => n !in n.^link
}
run Acyclic
```

The model declares a singleton set of `List` and a set of `Node`
atoms.  Each `List` atom has zero or one `header` of type `Node`.
Each `Node` atom has zero or one following `Node` along `link`.
`header` and `link` are partial functions.  The predicate `Acyclic`
restricts the singleton set `List` to be acyclic.  The body of the
`Acyclic` predicate states that for all `n` of type `Node`, if `n` is
in the list (reachable from `List.header`), then it implies that `n`
is not reachable from itself following one or more traversals along
the `link`.  `all v: D | ...` is universal quantification.  `in` is
subset relation.  `.` is relational join.  `*` is reflexive transitive
closure.  `=>` is implication.  `!in` is the negation of subset
relation.  `^` is transitive closure.

## Alloy Instance

Below is an Alloy instance for the above list model which does not
satisfy the `Acyclic` predicate:

![List Instance](../documentation/images/ListInstance.png)

The instance states that there are a single `List` atom (`List0`) and
a single `Node` atom (`Node0`).  `List0`'s header is `Node0` and
`Node0`'s next node is `Node0`.  We can see that `List0` is cyclic as
there is a loop in the list.

## AUnit Test

An `AUnit` test is a pair of a model valuation and a run command.  For
example, the above Alloy instance can be written as an `AUnit` test as
below:
```Alloy
pred test {
  some List0: List | some Node0: Node {
    List = List0
    Node = Node0
    header = List0 -> Node0
    link = Node0 -> Node0
    !Acyclic[]
  }
}
run test
```

The test declares a single `List` atom (`List0`) and a single `Node`
 atom (`Node0`).  It restricts the entire `List` set to be {`List0`}
 and `Node` set to be {`Node0`}.  The predicate also states that the
 `header` maps `List0` to `Node0`, and the `link` maps `Node0` to
 `Node0`.  If you run the `test` predicate, you will obtain the
 isomorphic Alloy instance shown [above](#alloy-instance).

# Limitation

`ASketch` currently does not support sketching Alloy facts or
functions.  The workaround is to make facts as predicates and
explicitly invoke them when necessary.  We may support both facts and
functions in a future release.  In addition, we currently only support
sketching expressions of arity 1 and 2.
